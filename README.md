bash
Copy code
npm install
For Python:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory and define your variables (e.g., database connection, JWT secret, etc.). See Environment Variables section for more details.

API Endpoints
Below is a list of the core API endpoints. For detailed documentation on each endpoint, refer to the API Documentation.

env
Copy code
# Server Configurations
PORT=4000

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

# Database URL
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url

# Any other environment variables your project requires
Running the Application
